howdy! that my application. hope it reached all specifications. since was no deadlines on the project (at least I didn't received) I considered 3 days after I received the test email (Wed, Mar 13, 7:26â€¯PM to Sat, Mar 16, 7:26 PM). after submitting the form, I'll no longer update this repo.

techs used:
- Laravel 10.x
- Sail to "dockerize"
- Sanctum insted of Passport in auth
- Laravel DOMpdf to handle PDF gen
- PHPUnit to testing

I'll be leaving here a link to provide a sample of this exactly app running, and a link with all API docs.
